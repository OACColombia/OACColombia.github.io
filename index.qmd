Welcome to my site! 

I am a PhD candidate in Interdisciplinary Ecology ([SNRE](https://snre.ifas.ufl.edu/){target="_blank"}) with concentration in [Wildlife Ecology and Conservation](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/){target="_blank"}, advised by [Dr. Miguel Acevedo](https://maacevedo.github.io){target="_blank"}. I am also part of the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu){target="_blank"}, co-advised by [Dr. Scott Robinson](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/people/scott-robinson/){target="_blank"}, and the [Tropical Conservation and Development](https://uftcd.org){target="_blank"} program. 

My research interests are broad, ranging from participatory science and outreach programs to biodiversity monitoring and global change ecology, including the use of a variety of tools such as acoustics, community science, ecological modeling, and/or field exploration.

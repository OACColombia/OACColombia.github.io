## Selected publications
***Note regarding co-authorship on publications with students:*** My teaching and mentorship philosophy emphasizes the privilege of a mutually enriching exchange, where both parties gain and grow by engaging with each others interests, lines of inquiry, and discoveries. I denote the honor of collaborating with students by placing an asterisk (\*) after the title of these selected publications.

Total publications: 2 submitted or in review, 58 peer-reviewed (17 leading, 16 closing), and 43 other publications

Citations: 1344 (1217 since 2020).
